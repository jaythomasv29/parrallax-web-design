        <h2>Enjoy every square mile.</h2>
        <p>
            There are countless things to do in this city, but in homage to its compact size of 49 square miles, we’ve narrowed it down. From Alcatraz to vintage streetcars, iconic San Francisco attractions lure nearly 17 million visitors every year—but that doesn’t mean they’re just for tourists. Even the most jaded locals never tire of admiring iconic landmarks like the sweeping span of the Golden Gate Bridge. Crammed with top-notch restaurants, artisanal coffee shops, sidewalk cafés, unusual and excellent museums, pocket gardens, hidden stairways, and eclectic shops, the city invites exploration.
